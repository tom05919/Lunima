> Lunima is a photonic design environment for fast, physically grounded circuit exploration and system-level thinking.

---

## Purpose

Lunima provides a unified environment for designing, exploring, and communicating photonic circuits across teams and abstraction levels.

Rather than replacing existing simulation tools, Lunima focuses on:

- **Fast, intuitive circuit-level exploration**
- **Shared visual representation** of photonic systems
- **Bridging the gap** between design, simulation, and system-level understanding

---

## Vision: Photonic Intermediate Representation (PIR)

### The Central Idea

👉 **Lunima is becoming the central representation layer for photonic systems**

- **Today:** GUI-based design tool
- **Tomorrow:** Central PIR with multiple views and exports
- **Future:** Integration hub for PhotonTorch, PICWave, Verilog-A, LTSpice

### PIR = `.lun` File Format

The `.lun` file format is evolving to become the PIR — a tool-independent representation that:

- Defines components and connections as a **netlist / graph**
- Accumulates physical, structural, and simulation data over time
- Enables **export to and import from** different simulation tools
- Evolves from schematic → device simulation → circuit simulation → system co-simulation

**This means:**
- GUI is just one view of the PIR
- Export is just a transformation of the PIR
- AI becomes extremely powerful with structured access to PIR

### Role in the Photonics Toolchain

| Layer | Tools | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Device-level simulation** | Tidy3D, FimmProp, Lumerical MODE | EM simulation, S-matrix extraction |
| **Circuit-level simulation** | PICWave, PhotonTorch | System behavior using S-matrices |
| **System / Digital Twin** | Verilog-A, LTSpice, Xyce | Photonic + electronic co-simulation |

**Lunima's position:** Between schematic design and system-level simulation.

Lunima acts as a **design and integration layer**, allowing information to flow between tools rather than duplicating their functionality.
